# Ignition Remix

(*In Praise of Older Women*, Julika)

The tide turns in the river; day becomes dusk,
And you, as shy as a fox (or
My own heart) steal in,
In your mother's red silk nightdress:
Fringed with fur & a whisper of silver,
A quaint match for your 15 years.

This golden thirst, blessed hunger:

...

Young girls should show their nightgowns
To men worthy of the name.

...

The branches blackened & bare in the courtyard
Because they could not be otherwise.
